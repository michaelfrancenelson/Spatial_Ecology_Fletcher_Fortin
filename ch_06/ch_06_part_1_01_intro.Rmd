# Introduction and Overview {.tabset}

This is a walkthroug of a spatial analysis workflow, based of section **6.3.3: Models that Ignore Spatial Dependence** in

> Fletcher, Robert; Fortin, Marie-JosÃ©e. Spatial Ecology and Conservation Modeling

I use data and modelling ideas from their text, with additional explanations and

- This walkthrough uses the **Simple Features** ecosystem of R spatial tools in this walkthrough.
- This walkthrough uses the `ggplot` plotting methods, for the most part.
- This walkthrough uses pipe operator `%>%` when appropriate:
    - I like to keep the envirnoment free of intermediate variables.
    - Pipes aren't always the best option, but they can make compace and elegant code.
    - Here is some info on from the <a href="https://cfss.uchicago.edu/notes/pipes/">University of Chicago</a>



## The data

Surveys for the varied thrush: *Ixoreus naevius*

- Sampling scheme:
- ~3km transects
- point surveys - 100m radius
- 10 pts/transect




## Errata

There are a number of errata in the code provided by the authors, both in the main text and the supplemental code.
I'll attempt to point out where I found issues and offer my corrections.

### general

- The authors' elevation raster files don't include projection information.
- The code in the text doesn't include projection info.
- The projection specification is found in the supplemental code.

### correlogram function

There is a mistake in the definition of the `moran.results` data frame:

They define two columns called `null.lower`, however one of them should have been `null.upper`
