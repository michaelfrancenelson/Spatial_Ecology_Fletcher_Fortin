Functions for creating and plotting correlograms

## Correlogram functions

This is my version of the authors' function for calculating a correlogram.

<div class="warn">
Note that there is a mistake in the definition of the `moran.results` data frame.

They define two columns called `null.lower`, however one of them should have been `null.upper`
</div>

<div class="fold s">
```{r  plot_ff_correlogram, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE}
```
</div>




## Plot correlogram
There's also a convenience function for plotting the resulting correlogram.
<div class="fold s">
```{r  ff_correlogram, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE}
```
</div>
